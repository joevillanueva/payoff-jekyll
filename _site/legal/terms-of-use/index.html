	<p>
	  As part of delivering the products and services on the Site, Payoff works with certain third party providers who may directly or through access to other third party sites provide Payoff with a Registered User’s personal information (“Personal Information”) with such user’s permission (“Third Party Provider”). By using certain services of Payoff, if applicable, you authorize Payoff and Third Party Provider to access third party websites designated by you, on your behalf, to retrieve information requested by you, and to register for accounts requested by you. For all purposes hereof, you hereby grant Payoff and Third Party Provider a limited power of attorney, and you hereby appoint Payoff and Third Party Provider as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to access third party websites, servers or documents, retrieve information, and use your information, all as described above, with the full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such activities, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN PAYOFF OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDER ACCESSES AND RETRIEVES INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY WEBSITES, PAYOFF AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDER ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT THE AGENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY.

You acknowledge that use of any Third-Party Sites is governed by the terms of use for those websites, and not by this Agreement.

Such Third-Party Sites may have a privacy policy different from that of Payoff and the Third-Party Site may provide less security than this Site. Payoff is not responsible for the content of any third-party websites, nor does Payoff make any warranties or representations, express or implied, regarding the content (or the accuracy of such content) on any third-party websites, and Payoff shall have no liability of any nature whatsoever for any failure of products or services offered or advertised at such sites or otherwise.

	  From time to time, alone or in connection with a product or service, Payoff may ask questions related to your behavior, personality, and other things related to how you think and feel. This information allows us to complete, in specific or in aggregate, psychological assessments. The assessment results and feedback are developed to meet professional standards and as such are subject to the limitations of psychological science. The information we collect from these assessments will be used to help us provide you more focused customer service, individualized web experiences, more accurate risk management and better financial education. Your assessment may use procedures that are not evident to you. Your feedback may differ from your own perceptions of yourself.            
	</p>

	<p>
	  Payoff may retain and use, subject to the terms of our Privacy Statement, information collected from you.
