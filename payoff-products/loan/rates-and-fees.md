	<p>We want you to be out of credit card debt in just a few years. The Payoff Loan offers a low, fixed rate, and getting a quote only takes minutes and doesn’t impact your credit score.</p>
	<p>We’re on your side. That means simplifying fees and eliminating common ones, like late fees and prepayment penalties, that you see elsewhere. This is about defeating debt together, and neither of us can win with fees holding us back from our goals.</p>
	<p>We offer fixed rates between 6.00% (8% APR) and 19.65% (22% APR) for loan amounts from $5,000 to $25,000. Currently, the maximum APR in NY is 16%.</p>
	<p>No teaser or introductory rates that change after 12 or 18 months. This is about reducing your interest rate versus your credit cards, saving you thousands of dollars in interest and years of paying back debt. It’s as simple as that.</p>
	<p>Start saving immediately! Check your rate at no risk in 60 seconds.</p>

	<h3>Fees We’ve Eliminated</h3>
	<p>Many credit card companies and lenders charge small, hidden fees that aren't in your best interest. We wouldn't want to be charged those fees either. They don't help you get out of debt, so we've eliminated them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No Application Fees</strong> - Our online application is both easy and free.</li>
		<li><strong>No Prepayment Penalties or Fees</strong> - We want you to use any extra money you earn to pay down your balance.</li>
		<li><strong>No Late Fees</strong> - We understand the fear of a paycheck not coming on time, so we don’t charge late payments.</li>
		<li><strong>No Check Processing Fees</strong> - If you ever have to pay via check, instead of the standard automatic withdrawal, that’s fine by us.</li>
		<li><strong>No Annual Fees</strong> - We charge $0 in annual fees for the life of your loan, unlike many credit card companies.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	<h3>Payoff Platform Fee</h3>
	<p>We’ve simplified the true loan cost by combining the origination fee/closing fee and the maintenance fee into one: the Payoff Platform Fee. The Payoff Platform Fee includes the same costs as any other loan, and our rates are competitive with other lenders. This amount covers all of our services and is the full difference between the interest rate and the effective APR.</p>
	<p>This one-time fee is deducted from your requested amount at the time your loan is issued.</p>
	<p>The Payoff Platform fee ranges from 2% - 5%, and is based on the length of the loan.</p>

	<h3>Returned Payment Fee</h3>
	<p>A $15 fee may be charged if we can’t process your loan payment (for example, if there’s not enough money in your account to make your payment), which helps us offset the bank charges from failed payment transactions.</p>
	<p>This is the only other fee we charge.</p>
