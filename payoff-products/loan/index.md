	<h3>Rates & Fees</h3>

	<p>We want you to be out of credit card debt in just a few years. The Payoff Loan offers a low, fixed rate, and getting a quote only takes minutes and doesn’t impact your credit score.</p>
	<p>We’re on your side. That means simplifying fees and eliminating common ones, like late fees and prepayment penalties, that you see elsewhere. This is about defeating debt together, and neither of us can win with fees holding us back from our goals.</p>
	<p>We offer fixed rates between 6.00% (8% APR) and 19.65% (22% APR) for loan amounts from $5,000 to $25,000. Currently, the maximum APR in NY is 16%.</p>
	<p>No teaser or introductory rates that change after 12 or 18 months. This is about reducing your interest rate versus your credit cards, saving you thousands of dollars in interest and years of paying back debt. It’s as simple as that.</p>
	<p>Start saving immediately! Check your rate at no risk in 60 seconds.</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>Fees We’ve Eliminated</h3>
	<p>Many credit card companies and lenders charge small, hidden fees that aren't in your best interest. We wouldn't want to be charged those fees either. They don't help you get out of debt, so we've eliminated them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No Application Fees</strong> - Our online application is both easy and free.</li>
		<li><strong>No Prepayment Penalties or Fees</strong> - We want you to use any extra money you earn to pay down your balance.</li>
		<li><strong>No Late Fees</strong> - We understand the fear of a paycheck not coming on time, so we don’t charge late payments.</li>
		<li><strong>No Check Processing Fees</strong> - If you ever have to pay via check, instead of the standard automatic withdrawal, that’s fine by us.</li>
		<li><strong>No Annual Fees</strong> - We charge $0 in annual fees for the life of your loan, unlike many credit card companies.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	<h3>Payoff Platform Fee</h3>
	<p>We’ve simplified the true loan cost by combining the origination fee/closing fee and the maintenance fee into one: the Payoff Platform Fee. The Payoff Platform Fee includes the same costs as any other loan, and our rates are competitive with other lenders. This amount covers all of our services and is the full difference between the interest rate and the effective APR.</p>
	<p>This one-time fee is deducted from your requested amount at the time your loan is issued.</p>
	<p>The Payoff Platform fee ranges from 2% - 5%, and is based on the length of the loan.</p>

	<hr />
	<h3>Returned Payment Fee</h3>
	<p>A $15 fee may be charged if we can’t process your loan payment (for example, if there’s not enough money in your account to make your payment), which helps us offset the bank charges from failed payment transactions.</p>
	<p>This is the only other fee we charge.</p>

	<h3>Getting Approved</h3>

	<p class="lead">At Payoff, we want you to understand what goes into our decision process (the bankers call it underwriting) when reviewing your Payoff Loan™ application. That's why we're committed to giving you clear and simple explanations of the factors that we, and our bank partners, use and why we use them.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>FICO Score</h4>
	<p>Your FICO score summarizes your credit history in an easy-to-understand number. It doesn't tell your whole story though, so we use others factors too.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> A score of 660 or higher.</small></p>
	<hr />
	<h4>Debt-To-Income Ratio (Unsecured)</h4>
	<p>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is your total unsecured debt (personal loans, credit cards, etc.) divided by your annual income. A low debt-to-income ratio demonstrates a good balance between debt and income.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> A DTI less than or equal to 50%.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Age of Credit History</h4>
	<p>Age of credit history is the total length of time you've been using credit. This shows your credit maturity starting from your first line of credit, so remember to keep your old cards open.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> At least 3 years of credit.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Open and Satisfactory Trades</h4>
	<p>Open and satisfactory trades are the lines of credit on which you've opened and made payments on time. Making on-time payments is an important part of paying off your credit cards.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> At least 2 open and satisfactory trades and no more than one installment loan within the last 12 months.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Delinquencies</h4>
	<p>Credit delinquencies are payments that you owe and have not currently paid. If you have any, we suggest resolving these before applying for a Payoff Loan™ for your best chance of approval.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> No current delinquencies. Also, no delinquencies greater than 90 days within the last 12 months.</small></p>
