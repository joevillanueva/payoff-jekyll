<section id="getting-approved">

	<h3>Getting Approved</h3>

	<p class="lead">At Payoff, we want you to understand what goes into our decision process (the bankers call it underwriting) when reviewing your Payoff Loan™ application. That's why we're committed to giving you clear and simple explanations of the factors that we, and our bank partners, use and why we use them.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>FICO Score</h4>
	<p>Your FICO score summarizes your credit history in an easy-to-understand number. It doesn't tell your whole story though, so we use others factors too.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> A score of 660 or higher.</small></p>
	<hr />
	<h4>Debt-To-Income Ratio (Unsecured)</h4>
	<p>Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is your total unsecured debt (personal loans, credit cards, etc.) divided by your annual income. A low debt-to-income ratio demonstrates a good balance between debt and income.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> A DTI less than or equal to 50%.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Age of Credit History</h4>
	<p>Age of credit history is the total length of time you've been using credit. This shows your credit maturity starting from your first line of credit, so remember to keep your old cards open.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> At least 3 years of credit.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Open and Satisfactory Trades</h4>
	<p>Open and satisfactory trades are the lines of credit on which you've opened and made payments on time. Making on-time payments is an important part of paying off your credit cards.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> At least 2 open and satisfactory trades and no more than one installment loan within the last 12 months.</small></p>
		<hr />
	<h4>Delinquencies</h4>
	<p>Credit delinquencies are payments that you owe and have not currently paid. If you have any, we suggest resolving these before applying for a Payoff Loan™ for your best chance of approval.</p>
	<p><small class="requirement"><strong>Requirement:</strong> No current delinquencies. Also, no delinquencies greater than 90 days within the last 12 months.</small></p>
