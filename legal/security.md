      <h4>Certified By Experts</h4>
      <p>
          Payoff maintains state of the art security practices and is certified by McAfee. We hire the best security experts to conduct periodic security reviews and vulnerability assessments.
      </p>
      <h4>Secure Hosting</h4>
      <p>
          We store all sensitive financial data such as Social Security numbers and bank accounts in a highly secure, SOC II / PCI compliant environment. We use 256-bit bank-level encryption and security.
      </p>
      <h4>Passwords</h4>
      <p>At a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you can regain
      access to your account should you forget your password, including the use of a security question. Your password is not known to any employee or
      third party with whom we may partner, and we will never ask for your password as a means of identifying yourself over the phone or email.
      You should never share your password with anyone, and if you ever receive an email appearing to come from Payoff that asks for your password,
      you should immediately report this to <a href="mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79@%70%61%79%6f%66%66.%63%6f%6d">privacy@payoff.com</a>.</p>
      <h4>Session Time-Outs</h4>
      <p>
          We employ session time-outs to protect your account. This feature reduces the risk of unauthorized people being able to access your account if you
          leave your computer unattended. You will be logged out of the site automatically after a period of inactivity.
      </p>
      <h4>ID Theft</h4>
      <p>
      Payoff utilizes state of the art authentication technology to verify identities. If you suspect someone has stolen your identity and used it on the
      Payoff Site, please email
      <a href="mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79@%70%61%79%6f%66%66.%63%6f%6d">privacy@payoff.com</a>.
       Payoff will work diligently to investigate all credible claims and involve law enforcement authorities
      to assist and prosecute anyone who has committed identity theft.
