	<h4>Why the Balloon?</h4>
	<p>Glad you asked. Hi, I’m Scott Saunders, and I started Payoff to restore humanity and bring a little levity to financial services. With the balloons, I wanted a symbol for the freedom from debt I want everyone to have, my optimism for the future of the industry, and the celebrations we’ll have when you achieve your Payoff goals!</p>
	<p>So you may say, “Scott. Aren't balloons a little silly? Working to pay off my debt is a serious and heavy burden.” And to that I’d respond, “Paying off debt is serious business, but we need to keep a lighthearted perspective on the journey and constantly remind ourselves that we’ll be traveling lighter when our debt is gone.”</p>
	<p>Remember, hard work pays off, but you can’t do this alone. I know that, together, we can form a cause-centered community and achieve a future free of debt, because if you tie enough balloons together, then you can lift up anything and reach heights you never thought were possible.</p>
